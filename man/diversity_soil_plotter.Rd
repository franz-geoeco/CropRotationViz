\title{Create a Boxplot Visualization of Soil Potential by Agricultural Diversity Categories}
\usage{
diversity_soil_plotter(data, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
\item BISCALE: Spatial data frame with diversity metrics and BS (soil potential) values
\item color_pal: Color palette function for bivariate mapping (not used in this function)
\item labels1: List with bi_x and bi_y labels for creating category labels
}}

\item{type}{Character string indicating the geographic unit type ("District" or "River Basin")
Note: Currently not used in the function but maintained for consistency with other functions}
}
\value{
A ggplot object displaying:
\itemize{
\item Boxplots for each bivariate diversity category (bi_class)
\item Color-coded boxes matching the diversity mapper color scheme
\item X-axis labels showing both unique crops and transitions values
\item Y-axis showing soil potential distribution
\item Outliers highlighted with white-filled points
}
}
\description{
This function generates a static boxplot visualization showing the distribution of soil
potential (BS values) across different bivariate agricultural diversity categories.
The plot uses the same color scheme as the diversity mapper to maintain visual consistency,
allowing users to explore the relationship between crop diversity patterns and underlying
soil conditions. Each box represents the distribution of soil potential values within
a specific combination of unique crops and crop transitions.
}
\details{
The function creates a comprehensive view of how soil potential varies across the nine
possible combinations of crop diversity categories (3x3 grid from low to high unique crops
and low to high transitions). This visualization complements the spatial mapping by
providing statistical summaries of the soil-diversity relationship.
