\title{Process Crop Transitions for Specific Crop Type}
\usage{
process_specific_transitions(data, crop)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing aggregated crop transition data with columns starting with "Aggregated_"
followed by year numbers, and a freq column for transition frequencies}

\item{crop}{Character string specifying the crop type to analyze transitions for}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item source: Origin crop type (with "(before)" suffix for transitions into target crop)
\item target: Destination crop type (with "(after)" suffix for transitions from source crop)
\item value: Percentage of transitions between the crop pairs
}
}
\description{
Analyze and summarize temporal transitions into and out of a specific crop type
across multiple years using aggregated agricultural data.
}
\details{
This function processes temporal crop rotation patterns by identifying transitions where the specified
crop appears as either the source or target. It handles multi-year transitions by pairing consecutive
years and aggregates frequencies into percentages. The output distinguishes between transitions into
the crop (marked as "before") and out of the crop (marked as "after").
